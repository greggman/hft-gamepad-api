It's **SUPER EASY TO USE**

Just put the `dist/happyfuntimes-gamepad-emu.min.js` file somewhere and include it at the bottom of your HTML file

   <script src="happyfuntimes-gamepad-emu.min.js"></script>

* Then [run happyfuntimes](http://superhappyfuntimes.net).
* Start your game
* Make sure your smartphone is on the same WiFi as the computer running your game
* On your phone's browser go to `happyfuntimes.net`

In a moment the phone should connect to your game and offer a dpad and 2 buttons. You can connect
any number of phones up to the limit of your WiFi setup.
